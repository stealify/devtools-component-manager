# devtools-component-manager
a @stealfy/components compatible component manager implemented using devtools. We call that Handle Based PeerConnections but we are not sure where to land the port or merge Stealify will maybe get a large MonoRepo Soon.

can be used with the node-component-manager for interop between multiple context scenarios to build cross platform apps. based on the stealify component system
it implements mainly methods to run Tasks in diffrent remote contexts via the devtools debugging protocol as also tracking and linking contexts.
